## **User Question**
> I want to install OS on physical servers HPE, there are 143 servers to be done, I connect to iLO and install them one by one, which tool takes care of it automatically?

## **Answer**
For automating OS installation on a large batch of **HPE physical servers** via **iLO**, you don’t need to manually mount ISOs and click through 143 times — HPE provides tooling for exactly this scenario.

---

### **1. HPE OneView + Server Profile Templates**
- **What it does**: Lets you define an OS deployment template (including firmware, BIOS settings, RAID config, and OS image) and apply it to multiple servers at once.
- **How it helps**: You create one server profile, link it to a deployment plan, and apply it to all 143 systems.
- **Automation level**: High — minimal manual intervention after the initial template is set.
- **Extra**: Can integrate with Ansible or Terraform for scripting.

### **2. HPE iLO Amplifier Pack**
- **What it does**: Discovers hundreds of servers, pushes firmware, and can initiate scripted OS installations via Intelligent Provisioning or PXE.
- **How it helps**: You can mass-mount virtual media and start installations remotely.
- **Automation level**: Medium — better with PXE kickstart integration.

### **3. PXE Boot + Kickstart / Preseed (Recommended for speed)**
- **What it does**: Uses a network boot server to automatically load and install the OS (RHEL, CentOS, Ubuntu, Windows) without interaction.
- **How it helps**: After setting BIOS/iLO to PXE first boot, all servers will auto-install the OS with your predefined configuration.
- **Automation level**: Very high — one command to start 143 installs.
- **Extra**: Can be triggered through iLO scripting (`hponcfg` or Redfish API) to set PXE boot order remotely.

### **4. HPE Insight Control server provisioning (ICsp)** *(Legacy but still used in some environments)*
- **What it does**: Full lifecycle provisioning, from bare-metal to OS-ready, over the network.
- **How it helps**: Same as OneView but older — some admins prefer it for non-OneView environments.

---

💡 **Best Practical Workflow for 143 servers**  
1. Use **iLO Redfish API or Ansible modules** to:
   - Set PXE boot as first boot device.
   - Power cycle the servers.
2. Have a **PXE + Kickstart/Preseed** environment ready with your OS image.
3. Servers boot, pull configs, and install OS automatically.
4. Post-install scripts can register them in monitoring, update packages, and set credentials.

## **User Follow-up**
> what is kickstart

## **Answer**
Kickstart is basically a **hands-free installer** for Linux.

Instead of you sitting there clicking “Next” 20 times, Kickstart uses a **pre-written configuration file** that tells the installer *everything* it needs to know — disk partitioning, timezone, network settings, packages, root password, etc.

---

### **How It Works**
1. **You prepare a Kickstart file** (`ks.cfg`), which is just a text file with installation instructions.
2. **Server boots from network (PXE) or ISO** and the installer is told:  
   > “Use this kickstart file”
3. The installer reads your instructions and installs the OS automatically — no manual input.
4. After reboot, the server is ready with your predefined settings.

### **Example Kickstart for RHEL/CentOS**
```kickstart
# Install OS instead of upgrade
install
# Use network installation
url --url=http://mirror.centos.org/centos/7/os/x86_64/
# Set language
lang en_US.UTF-8
# Set keyboard
keyboard us
# Set timezone
timezone UTC
# Root password
rootpw --plaintext mysecurepassword
# Network config
network --bootproto=dhcp --device=eth0 --onboot=on
# Partitioning
clearpart --all --initlabel
autopart
# Packages
%packages
@core
vim
%end
# Post-install script
%post
echo "Kickstart complete" > /root/install.log
%end
