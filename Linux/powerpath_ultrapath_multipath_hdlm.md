# Storage Multipathing Solutions Guide

## Overview

Storage multipathing is a critical technology that provides redundancy, load balancing, and high availability for connections between servers and storage systems. This guide covers four major multipathing solutions: UltraPath, Multipath, PowerPath, and HDLM (Hitachi Dynamic Link Manager).

## What is Multipathing?

Multipathing enables a server to access storage devices through multiple physical paths, providing:
- **Redundancy**: If one path fails, others remain available
- **Load balancing**: Distributes I/O across multiple paths for better performance
- **High availability**: Automatic failover and failback capabilities
- **Path optimization**: Intelligent path selection based on performance metrics
