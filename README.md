## 🏗️ How it works

- Folder = Category:
-- Each top-level folder (e.g., Python/, Linux/) represents a content category.

- Markdown File = Post:
-- Every .md file inside these folders is considered a blog post.

- Post Title Formatting:
-- Posts are displayed as Category - PostName, e.g., Python/post1.md shows as Python - post1.

- Sorted by Last Modified Date:
-- Posts are automatically sorted by their file modification date, showing the newest posts first.

- GitHub Actions automatically generates a beautiful website
